/**
 * URL-toggleable flags for A/B-testing perf patches during development.
 *
 * Not part of the public API (never barrel-exported, never imported into
 * src/index.ts) — this is a throwaway harness for the fetch-pattern audit.
 * Each patch that changes runtime behavior gets one flag named after its
 * patch id (e.g. "p2"). Convention:
 *   - flag OFF (default, or param absent) → previous/control behavior
 *   - flag ON  (?p2=1)                    → the patch's new behavior
 * Bench with both to compare, then once a patch is confirmed good, delete
 * the flag/guard from the code (and its entry below) — the new behavior
 * becomes the only behavior.
 *
 * Only readable on the main thread — a dedicated Worker's `self.location` is
 * the worker script's own URL, not the page's, so it can't see these params.
 * A flag that needs to affect worker-side code (e.g. zarr-chunk-worker.ts)
 * must be read here on the main thread and forwarded explicitly through the
 * existing `init`/`loadBrick` postMessage payload, the same way `is16bit` and
 * `targetFormat` are already threaded through — do not try to read
 * `self.location` from inside a worker.
